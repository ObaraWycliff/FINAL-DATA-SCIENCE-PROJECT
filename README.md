# Data Analysis App 📊

This Streamlit web application serves as a basic tool for generating overview information from uploaded CSV or Excel files. It provides users, including data analysts, researchers, and business professionals, with a simple interface to explore, analyze, and visualize datasets for preliminary insights.

## Objective 🎯

The objective of this Data Analysis App is to offer users a straightforward platform for conducting basic data analysis tasks. By providing essential analytical tools and visualization options, the application aims to facilitate quick exploration of datasets and generate high-level overview information without requiring advanced technical skills.

## Problem Statement 🚀

Analyzing data from various sources often involves complex processes that may be overwhelming for non-technical users. Traditional data analysis software often requires extensive training and expertise to use effectively, limiting accessibility for individuals without a background in data science.

To address this challenge, the Data Analysis App offers a simplified approach to data analysis, focusing on providing users with basic overview information from their datasets. By prioritizing ease of use and simplicity, the application aims to democratize access to data insights and empower users to make informed decisions based on preliminary analysis results.

## Getting Started 🚀

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary libraries by running:

    ```bash
    pip install streamlit pandas numpy scipy statsmodels plotly seaborn matplotlib
    ```

2. Save the provided code into a Python file (e.g., `data_analysis_app.py`).

3. Run the Streamlit app by executing:

    ```bash
    streamlit run data_analysis_app.py
    ```

4. Upload your CSV or Excel file containing the data for analysis.
